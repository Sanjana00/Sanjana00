# Hello, World!

### You know me as Sanjana

###### (She/They)

Or maybe you know me as Sancho. Some special people know me as Chotik. 

I am currently a second year student of **Computer Science** at IIESTS. I am 20 years old and I started my coding journey 5 years ago, in `Java`. 

One year ago, I picked up `Python` by myself. I need to code in `C` for the college coding labs and I am currently trying out `C++`. I've had some fun with `Haskell`, `Go` and `MATLAB`. 

I mainly code in `Python` these days.

### My Interests

I knew I liked computing from a fairly young age, but to this date I have not been able to pinpoint a particular domain to call it my interest. I've always been a bit of a *"Jack of All Trades"* character. Recently, I've realised I'm comfortable with calling myself an ***Explorer***. 

In my free time, I catch up on some extra studies in theoretical computing or get started on some project in my long to-do list. I also enjoy problem solving and I am particularly intrigued by puzzles (but that does not mean I'm very good at them!).

### My Communities

Apart from being a second year student in the CS Department, I am also a **Women Techmakers Engineering Fellow** under *Google* and *TalentSprint*. This is an experiential program along with 125 other girls my age from all over India. I owe a lot to this supportive, encouraging and self-improving community (including my peers, mentors and instructors).

### Hobbies

- I have been teaching myself **Japanese** for over a year now
- Football player, CB, Jersey no. 4
- Passionate book ~~reader~~ collector (I also collect bookmarks from different countries~!)

#### Fun Fact: I drew my profile icon (PyParty) as well as this illustration depicting my permanent state (Codenashi)
